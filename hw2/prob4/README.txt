make use of pointers.

Similar to K&R exercise 5-9, write a program that converts the Day of Year to its corresponding Month and Day and vice versa
(convert Month and Day to Day of Year). Read sections 5.7-5.9 and rewrite the routines day_of_year and month_day with pointers
 instead of indexing. (As always, I will be looking at your code.) As with the code in K&R you should take into account leap years. Results should be printed to the console.
