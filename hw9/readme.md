This is Prob 5 - Graph Database

GRAPH DATABASE: Implement a graph database API in Javascript and Sqlite. A graph is a set of nodes and a set of edges. Nodes can have data associated with them. Edges connect a source node with a destination node, and can also have data associated with them. You can assume the data are always strings for now. Users of the API should be able to make a new graph, add, delete, and modify nodes and edges, and save their graphs in the database. They should be able to perform basic queries on a graph such as list all the incoming or outgoing edges, or all the nodes whose data match a given string, etc.
